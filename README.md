# word-guess-cli

Welcome to this hangman-style node.js application. Users are prompted to guess a letter in order to find out if that letter is part of the hidden word. The letters gradually appear in the word as they are guessed. Guess all of the correct letters and you will win, but run out of lives and you will lose. This application employs the "inquirer" npm package, as well as JavaScript constructors. 

Enjoy!
